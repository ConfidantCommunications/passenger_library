This guide assumes that you are already familiar with Passenger's basic concepts and that you are already familiar with <%= integration_mode_name %> (and thus that you chose <%= integration_mode_name %> for a reason).

 * Not familiar with Passenger, or looking to run Passenger in a development environment instead? Then please take a look at the [quickstart](<%= url_for '/tutorials/quickstart/ruby/index.html' %>) and the rest of the tutorial guides.
 * Not familiar with <%= integration_mode_name %>? Please follow [the end-to-end deployment tutorial](<%= url_for '/tutorials/deploy_to_production/index.html' %>) instead, which guide you through the entire installation process, including installing the programming language runtime that your application needs.
 * This guide is for *first time installations* only. If you are upgrading, please refer to the [upgrade guide](<%= url_for "/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/upgrade.html" %>).
