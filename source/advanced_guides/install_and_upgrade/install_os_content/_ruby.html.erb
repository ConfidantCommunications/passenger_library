<p>
  Passenger supports multiple languages and its core is written in C++, but its installer and administration tools are written in Ruby, so you must install Ruby.
</p>
<p>
  Even though Ruby is required, Ruby will normally not be loaded during normal operation unless you deploy a Ruby web application on Passenger. Passenger's dependency on Ruby is very minimal. See <a href="<%= url_for '/indepth/lightweight_ruby_dependency.html' %>">Lightweight Ruby dependency</a> for details.
