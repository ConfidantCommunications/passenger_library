# Non-interactive, automatic, headless installs or upgrades
<%= render_partial('/shared/current_selection', locals: { disabled_selections: [:lang] }) %>

Passenger and Passenger Enterprise can be installed in a non-interactive, automatic, headless manner. This is perfect in automated scenarios, e.g. when using Chef or Puppet, or when building a Docker container.

This guide assumes that you are already familiar with installing Passenger manually. If not, please read the [installation guide](<%= url_for "/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/install/index.html" %>).

The instructions in this guide apply equally to the open source version and to the Enterprise version.

## Debian packages

If you are on a Debian or Ubuntu operating system, then the recommended way to install Passenger is through [APT](<%= url_for "/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/apt_repo.html" %>). While installing the Passenger packages through APT, you can pass `-y` to `apt-get install` to have it run non-interactively. For example:

    sudo apt-get install -y passenger

## RPM packages

If you are on an Enterprise Linux operating system, then the recommended way to install Passenger is through [YUM](<%= url_for "/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/yum_repo.html" %>). While installing the Passenger packages through YUM, you can pass `-y` to `yum install` to have it run non-interactively. For example:

    sudo yum install -y --enablerepo=epel passenger

## Source tarball or RubyGems installation

<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx || integration_mode_type == :apache %>
  <p>
    Recall that while installing Passenger <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %>, the installation process involves running an installer
    <% if integration_mode_type == :nginx -%>
      (<code>passenger-install-nginx-module</code>)
    <% else -%>
      (<code>passenger-install-apache2-module</code>)
    <% end -%>
    which is interactive. You can run the installer non-interactively by passing various answers to the installer through command line options. Please run the installer with <code>--help</code> for a list of available command line options. Here is an example which show how to run it non-interactively:
  </p>

  <div>
    <% if integration_mode_type == :nginx -%>
      <pre class="highlight">passenger-install-nginx-module --auto --auto-download --prefix=/opt/nginx</pre>

      <p>
        You can also achieve non-interactive installation by <a href="<%= url_for "/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/install_as_nginx_module.html" %>">installing Passenger as a normal Nginx module</a>.
      </p>
    <% else %>
      <pre class="highlight">passenger-install-apache2-module --auto</pre>
    <% end %>
  </div>
<% else %>
  <p>
    If you are using Passenger in its Standalone mode, then you should run the following commands right after installing Passenger. These will download any necessary files immediately, which would otherwise be downloading during the first run of <code>passenger start</code>.
  </p>

  <pre class="highlight">passenger-config install-standalone-runtime
passenger-config build-native-support</pre>
<% end %>
